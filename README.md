MY USER STORY
AS AN aspiring web developer
I WANT to create an articulate portfolio website showcasing work samples and side projects such as YouTube and Twich
SO THAT I can display my web development skills with a focus on optimization and accessibility for all users

SUPPLIED USER STORY
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
